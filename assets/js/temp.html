<h1>Objective:</h1>>
<p>Provide a web-based tool for MCPS schools to calculate their current carbon footprint based on individual school
    inputs.
    This will allow the school administrators to create a baseline and track progress to mitigate their carbon
    footprint.
</p>

<h2> What does this site do?</h2>>
<p> This website is a Carbon Footprint Calculator for MCPS modeled along the lines of the EPA Carbon footprint
    calculator.
    This calculator estimates the carbon footprint attributable to each schoolâ€™s activities such as transportation
    services, energy consumption, and net waste generated.
</p>
<h2 Inputs Required></h2>

<nl>Carbon footprint from Transportation
    <li>Numbers of school buses used, and private cars used for carpools. </li>
    <li> Miles driven per year by each bus and car. </li>
</nl>
<pre>
  Carbon emissions for buses = 
       (Miles driven each year x # of school buses) /Average mileage x emission rate
  Carbon emissions for cars = 
       (Miles driven each year x # of cars * emission rate) converted to pounds for CO2
  This computation factors tailpipe emission and not upstream emission.
</pre>

<nl>Carbon footprint from Energy Consumption
    <li> Monthly consumption for heating (Natural Gas or Fuel Oil or Electricity)</li>
    <li> Monthly consumption for electricity (electricity or other)</li>
</nl>
<pre>Carbon emission = Annual fuel consumption x emission rate</pre>


<nl>Carbon footprint from Waste:
    <li> Annual waste generated for these categories - Recycle, Landfill, Combust, Compost, and Anaerobically Digested
    </li>
</nl>

<nl>How can schools reduce their carbon footprint?</nl>
<li>Convert school buses to electric and encourage walkers. </li>
<li>Install solar panels.</li>
<li>Replace incandescent light bulbs with LED or other ENERGY STAR lights.</li>
<li>Turn up/down the AC and heating thermostat in the summer and winter months.</li>
